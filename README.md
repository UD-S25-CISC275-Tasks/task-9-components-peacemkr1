# React TypeScript Tome Tasks

Hello! This repository has been pre-configured with eslint, prettier, and a github actions workflow to automatically lint and format your code on every push. It'll also deploy your site for you.

You'll complete programming problems by merging in upstream branches. Check out the textbook for more information: <https://frontend-fun.github.io/react-hooks-typescript-tome/>
